# Chain-Flocking
A test with emergent behaviour based on simple flocking algorithms

This is a small test I did to get a better feel for emergent systems and the kind of complex behaviours that can come from seemingly simple rules. I have many tests like this but I have chosen to upload this one to github as it is the easiest to intuitively understand.

The code was written summer 2018.
