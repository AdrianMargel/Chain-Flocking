# Chain Flocking
A test with emergent behaviour based on simple flocking algorithms

This is a small test I did to get a better feel for emergent systems and the kind of complex behaviours that can come from seemingly simple rules. I have many tests like this but I have chosen to upload this one to github as it is the easiest to intuitively understand.

On a small scale it isn't too interesting but this changes with enough entities. The only downside is the render time slows down the more entities added. The following is a short low resolution video showing 20 thousand entities: https://i.imgur.com/SMOV6Gp.mp4

The code was written summer 2018.
